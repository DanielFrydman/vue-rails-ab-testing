## :rocket: Project
The developed application is a standalone AB Testing made in Ruby on Rails and VueJS.
<br>
Its goal is to assist the non-technical user to modify AB Testing and monitor the tracked data to check Clickthrough Rate(CTR).

## :tada: Features
- Visitor sees only one variation (assigned randomly) when they land on the page.
- The assigned variation doesn‚Äôt change after the page reloads.
- Track a pageview via the `analytics-api.js` method when a visitor lands on the page.
- Track an event via the `analytics-api.js` method when a visitor clicks on the ‚ÄúSign up‚Äù button.
- Every single page view and click shall be tracked.
- Calculate CTR by unique users and event name.
- Tracking Dashboard to see unique page views and events per user by event name and in chosen period
- Allow non-technical users to modify the control variation or the test variation texts in Hygraph CMS (Content management system).
- P.S.: The sign up page is for viewing only, it doesn't work like a real page
