## :rocket: Project
The developed application is a standalone AB Testing made in Ruby on Rails and VueJS.
<br>
Its goal is to assist the non-technical users to modify AB Testing and monitor the tracked data to check Clickthrough Rate(CTR).

## :tada: Features
- Visitor sees only one variation (assigned randomly) when they land on the page.
- The assigned variation doesn‚Äôt change after the page reloads.
- Track a pageview via the `analytics-api.js` method when a visitor lands on the page.
- Track an event via the `analytics-api.js` method when a visitor clicks on the ‚ÄúSign up‚Äù button.
- Every single page view and click shall be tracked.
- Calculate CTR by unique users and event name.
- Tracking Dashboard to see unique page views and events per user by event name and in chosen period.
- Allow non-technical users to modify the control variation or the test variation texts in Hygraph CMS (Content management system).
- P.S.: The sign up page is for viewing only, it doesn't work like a real page

## :pushpin: Information
You can test the application in the following URL: **https://vue-rails-ab-testing-3mmd.onrender.com**.
<br>
The page may take a while to load as it is a free service and the system sleeps but once it loads, it is quick.
<br>
The PostgreSQL DB in Render will be erased after 90 days.
<br>
***Please be aware that the link may be inactive, depending on when you access my repository, as the Render database associated with the free version could potentially have expired. Thank you for your understanding.***

## :postbox: Hygraph Project
If you want to change the `Control variation text` or the `Test variation text`, just send me a message with your email and I will add you to my Hygraph project. With the free version, I can only add two people.

<br>
It only has one model in the schema called AB Testing Variation with two single-line text fields: the first is `Control variation text` and the second is `Test variation text`.
